# sigmadelta
Repository for the paper "An ultra-low power sigma-delta neuron circuit

A python notebook demonstrating the use of the Spiker framework that allows the user to run transient simulation of a spiking neural network.

The notebook also demonstrates how a simple recurrent neural network framwork can be mapped to a sigma-delta spiking neural network model.

The notebook is a companion to the paper titled "An ultra-low power sigma-delta neural network" published by IEEE.
