The rep is a companion to the paper titled "An ultra-low power sigma-delta neural network" published by IEEE.

In addition the repo contains code showing how large and small networks may be mapped to the spiking domain. Examples also include demonstration of the effectiveness of the mapping procedure when data is resampled.
