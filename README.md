The notebook is a companion to the paper titled "An ultra-low power sigma-delta neural network" published by IEEE.

Example-1 is a python notebook demonstrating the use of the Spiker framework that allows the user to run transient simulation of a spiking neural network. The notebook also demonstrates how a simple recurrent neural network framwork can be mapped to a sigma-delta spiking neural network model.

The notebooks titled testbenches are simple sanity checks.

The MNIST example is broken at the moment.
