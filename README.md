The notebook is a companion to the paper titled "An ultra-low power sigma-delta neural network" published by IEEE.

Mapping is a python notebook demonstrating the use of the Spiker framework that allows the user to run transient simulation of a spiking neural network. The notebook also demonstrates how a simple recurrent neural network framwork can be mapped to a sigma-delta spiking neural network model. This notebook was use to generate the plots for the paper.

The notebooks titled testbenches are simple sanity checks.

For reference, please refer to the notebooks titled rnn.ipynb and rnn.py. The code there is much cleaner.
